1899_British_Lions_tour_to_Australia	1	It	is	retrospectively	classed	as	one	of	the	British	Lions	tours	,	as	the	Lions	naming	convention	was	not	adopted	until	1950	.

1899_Brooklyn_Superbas_season	4	His	contract	was	sold	to	the	Cleveland	Spiders	,	but	Griffin	never	played	or	managed	in	the	majors	again	.

1899_Brooklyn_Superbas_season	7	This	influx	of	talent	was	a	good	part	of	the	reason	why	the	Superbas	managed	to	win	the	National	League	pennant	with	101	wins	after	winning	just	54	games	in	1898	.
1899_CAHL_season	0	The	inaugural	1899	Canadian	Amateur	Hockey	League	-LRB-	CAHL	-RRB-	season	lasted	from	January	7	until	March	4	.

1899_Cleveland_Spiders_season	3	However	,	they	continued	to	retain	ownership	of	the	Cleveland	club	,	an	obvious	conflict	of	interest	that	was	later	outlawed	.
1899_Cleveland_Spiders_season	4	Stanley	Robison	publicly	announced	his	intention	to	run	the	Spiders	``	as	a	sideshow	,	''	and	fans	apparently	took	him	at	his	word	.

1899_Cleveland_Spiders_season	7	As	a	result	,	the	Spiders	only	played	26	more	home	games	for	the	rest	of	the	season	,	including	only	eight	after	July	1	.

18_cm_kurze_Kanone_M_80	2	These	wedges	helped	to	absorb	the	recoil	force	and	encouraged	the	wheels	to	run	forward	to	bring	the	gun	back	into	battery	.
18_cm_kurze_Kanone_M_80	3	Generally	a	wooden	firing	platform	was	constructed	for	these	guns	in	action	to	provide	a	level	and	smooth	surface	.
